Todo list
---------

* Automatically recompile document when any <tt>.md</tt> file is saved
* Tree navigation on left side
* Detect more errors when compiling documents (e.g. deadlinks)
* Save error messages in html
* Remember the scroll state for each column that is out of view
* In the hashlink, record the number of visible columns
* [Transitions should use CSS3](##usecss3)
* Link every word to a dictionary / wikipedia / DuckDuckGo lookup
* Automatically scroll to top when opening new column (any tips?)
* [Test in common browsers](##todo_browsers)
* Perhaps use namespaces for columnIds?
* When you clink on a link, highlight it with a glowing color, so you can easily remember where you came from in the previous column (like a bookmark).
* Add bootstrap.css
* Click an image for a popover view that fits the screen.
