Sidenote-link syntax
--------------------
 
Example:

        [Link text](##link_destination)

Sidenote adds one single addition to [Markdown](##markdown) syntax: *Sidenote links*.

A Sidenote link is a link from one column to another column.

In Markdown, a Sidenote link looks *almost* like a regular Markdown link. The only difference is that you use two **#** symbols instead of one.

The <tt>link_destination</tt> specifies the name of <tt>.md</tt> Markdown file you want to link to (leave off the <tt>.md</tt> extension).
