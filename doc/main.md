## Ideas

- Chrome extensions
    - Turn the entire Web into a Sidenote document. Opening a new tab opens
      a new Sidenote tab, instead of a new browser tab
    - Automatically turn every Wikipedia page into a new Sidenote document.
- Auto-link
    - You can give a tag a ``name''
        - Whenever the name appears in text, it is autolinked to that tab
        - Links are only underlined when you hover you mouse over them
        - Except for the first auto-link in the left-most column (which is
          permanently underlined)
