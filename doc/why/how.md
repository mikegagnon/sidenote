### How does Sidenote accomplish it's goal?
* The [left column](##left_column) presents highly summarized information.
* The **right column** contains detailed information.
* Sidenote avoids [context switches](##context_switch) in the reader's brain since both columns are always visible.
* A large font-size combined with a relatively slim column forces brevity upon the writer.
* Sidenote documents follow the [Visual Information Seeking Mantra](##viz_mantra)
