### Context switches

Using typical web pages, the reader experiences a **context switch** whenver she clicks a link.
She must switch from the *context of the previous page*, to the *context of the new page*.
Such switches are taxing on the brain.

In a well-written Sidenote document, however, links don't cause context switches.
The **previous column** is always visible on the left, and the **new column** appears along side of it.
Both columns have equal focus.

This is a crucial feature because the reader can **confidentially explore columns**, without worrying if the new column will be worth the click.
